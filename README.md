### *Have you ever been in a Casino?*</br> 
***The alluring atmosphere, the dazzling lights, the clinking of chips, and the intense anticipation in the air? One of the most iconic and widely played games you'll find there is*** **`Blackjack`,** ***also known as 21. The game's primary objective is to beat the dealer by having a hand value that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21. Each player competes individually against the dealer, and players do not compete against each other.***

> ## Here's a breakdown of how the game works:

### `Card Values`:
- Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each.
- An Ace can be worth either 1 point or 11 points, depending on what benefits the player's hand the most.

### `Gameplay`:
- Players place their bets before the game begins.
- Each player, including the dealer, is dealt two cards. Players' cards are usually face-up, while one of the dealer's cards is face-up (known as the "upcard") and the other is face-down (the "hole card").
- Players then have the option to take additional cards ("hit") to increase the value of their hand. They can request as many hits as they want, but the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
- Once a player decides to stop taking cards ("stand"), their final hand value is compared to the dealer's.
- The dealer reveals their hole card. The dealer is typically required to hit until their hand value is at least 17.
- If a player's hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and automatically lose the bet.
- If the player's hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's and doesn't exceed 21, the player wins and is paid out based on their bet.
- If the dealer's hand is closer to 21, the player loses their bet.
- If the player and dealer have the same hand value, it's a "push," and the player's bet is returned.

### `Splitting and Doubling Down`:

**Players have the option to split pairs of cards of the same rank into two separate hands. They then place an additional bet on the new hand. This is most commonly done with pairs of Aces or 8s.**</br>
**Doubling down allows players to double their original bet after receiving the first two cards, with the condition that they must take only one more card.**
